# React App Template

This is a template repository for creating React applications with Webpack, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-app-template.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd react-app-template
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run lint`: Lints TypeScript files using ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Formats TypeScript files using Prettier.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React app.
  - `components/`: React components used in the app.
  - `index.tsx`: Entry point for the React app.
  - `global.css`: TailwindCSS plugin imports and global css for the react app.
- `public/`: Static assets and HTML template.
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration file.
- `postcss.config.js`: PostCSS configuration file.
- `tailwindcss.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration file.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `package.json`: NPM packages file. (Feel free to update name in package.json according to your liking.)

## Customize Configuration

You can customize the configuration by modifying the following files:

- `webpack.config.js`: Adjust webpack settings for bundling assets.
- `tsconfig.json`: Configure TypeScript compiler options.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configure TailwindCSS options.

## Flexible Customization Options

This template provides a flexible setup that allows for extensive customization based on your preferences and project requirements. Unlike some templates that come with predefined Prettier or ESLint configurations, this template does not impose these configurations to give you more control over your development environment.
You can choose to add Prettier and ESLint configurations as per your coding style guidelines or completely customize your linting and formatting rules without any predefined constraints. This approach empowers you to tailor the development experience to suit your specific needs and standards.
Feel free to integrate Prettier and ESLint configurations by adding the necessary files (`prettierrc.js`, `.eslintrc.js`, etc.) and adjusting them according to your coding conventions. This level of customization ensures that you have full control over code formatting, linting rules, and other development tooling aspects.
